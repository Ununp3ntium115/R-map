# R-Map: Independent Project Notice

**R-Map is now a fully independent project** and is no longer a fork of nmap.

## Major Divergence

R-map has evolved into a complete autonomous AI security investigation platform:

### New Architecture (Not in nmap)
- ✅ **PYRO Fire Marshal Integration** - Investigation framework with Cryptex v2.0
- ✅ **Claude AI Autonomous Agent** - Built-in AI orchestration
- ✅ **redb Database** - Embedded, zero-dependency persistence
- ✅ **18 MCP Tools** - Model Context Protocol integration
- ✅ **Rust + Svelte Stack** - Modern reactive UI
- ✅ **Complete Rewrite** - 90%+ of code rewritten in Rust

### Lines of Code
- **Original nmap base:** ~50,000 lines (C++)
- **R-map additions:** ~15,000+ lines (Rust)
- **PYRO integration:** ~4,000 lines (Rust)
- **Total divergence:** Fundamentally different project

## Technology Stack Comparison

| Feature | nmap | R-map |
|---------|------|-------|
| Language | C++ | Rust |
| Database | None | redb (embedded) |
| UI | Zenmap (Python/GTK) | Svelte + Vite |
| AI Integration | None | Claude AI built-in |
| MCP Support | None | 18 tools |
| Fire Marshal | None | Full PYRO integration |
| Autonomous Workflows | None | ✅ Complete |

## Independent Features

1. **PYRO Fire Marshal Framework**
   - L1/L2/L3 investigation levels
   - Cryptex v2.0 compliance
   - Automated detonators
   - Evidence chain tracking

2. **Claude AI Agent**
   - Autonomous workflow orchestration
   - AI-driven analysis
   - Multi-step investigations
   - Real-time decision making

3. **redb Integration**
   - Persistent scan history
   - Event streaming
   - Zero external dependencies
   - ACID compliance

4. **Modern Architecture**
   - Async/await with Tokio
   - Type-safe Rust
   - Reactive Svelte UI
   - REST + WebSocket APIs

## Conclusion

**R-map is not a fork - it's an independent project** that started from nmap's signature databases but has completely diverged into its own autonomous AI security platform.

## GitHub Fork Status

If GitHub still shows "forked from nmap/nmap", this is outdated metadata.
